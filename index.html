                    Hi, and welcome to my Grand Challenges Scholars Program portfolio! My name is Daniel Personius and I am a computer science undergraduate at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado. I will be graduating this fall before moving to San Diego to be a data scientist for the communications company Viasat. As my final semester comes to a close, I would like to reflect on my time at Mines and how this program has shaped it.
                    <br><br>For readers who may not know, The GCSP is an outcomes-based program at eighty-one schools across many countries. It aims to enhance engineering students’ social, political, economic, and cultural awareness and skills, preparing them to take on the National Academy of Engineering’s Grand Challenges of Engineering. These are fourteen large-scale issues facing the 21st century, spanning borders, professions, and cultures. Problems like preventing nuclear terror, ensuring access to clean water, reverse engineering the brain, and engineering the tools for scientific discovery. Problems that we as a global society need to address in order to maintain our health, joy, security, and sustainability as a species. At Mines, the Scholars Program has students complete five pillars to educate them in more than just math and science: Interdisciplinary Curriculum, a Global Dimension, Entrepreneurship, Service Learning, and Research or Project Experience.
                    <br><br>Throughout the program, I have had many amazing opportunities to gain knowledge and experience in these areas of expertise. Next is a brief summary of each activity, followed by reflections, a synthesis piece, and my feedback on the program as a whole.

                    For my interdisciplinary experience, I completed two activities. My freshman year, I worked with a team of chemical and mechanical engineers on a term project for a Nature and Human Values(NHV) course. This course combined design and philosophy to introduce students to the core ideas of human-centered engineering. Over the course of a semester, we studied the living situations of the homeless population in Denver, Colorado, then proposed a product to improve those conditions. The problem we saw as most pressing at the time was homeless individuals’ access to nutritional food, mostly due to the high prices in the city and overcrowded, underfunded shelters. To mitigate this, we designed a donation system for restaurants and other places of business to transfer uneaten or extra food into distributed vending machines to be bought by homeless and low-income individuals. 
                    <br><br>Later on in my junior year, I entered a design competition with a team of fellow Scholars focused on the Grand Challenges. We had three months to design a product from scratch, create a company around it, and compete against teams from across the United States in Irvine, California. This winners of this stage moved on to pitch at the Global Student Collaboration Lab preceding the 2019 Grand Challenges Global Summit in London. We didn't advance, but our company Canary has lived on. Canary is a design for integrating personal air pollution masks into everyday clothing. Traditional masks are often avoided due to inconvenience and negative stigma in many countries, so we made a way for the important part of the mask, the air filter, to fit into more comfortable and appealing clothing, like Buffs, scarves, and jackets. This project was a wonderful experience for me — I had the chance to work on a meaningful product, learn from my peers of metallurgical, mechanical, chemical, and electrical engineers, and apply knowledge and skills learned from my Entrepreneurship pillar.

                    My Entrepreneurship competency was filled by co-founding a company my freshman year. Through a friend, I met a local business owner with an idea for a professional services startup and a need of both a software development team and people to market GavelGo — enabling small businesses to interact directly with potential customers through exlusive deals and auctions. For two and a half years, I worked to develop the technology for the company, as well as hire other developers, speak with legal consultants and potential investors, run beta tests with potential customers, write business plans and overview documents, and generate market reports. I left the company while it was still in development due to school and work constraints, but in my time with them, I gained a more clear understanding of how companies start and become successful, but more importantly, how and why they can fail.

We met once a week for a semester, each time with a lesson on fundamental programming concepts and an open-ended circuit build.
                    <br><br>I interned this summer as a software engineer for Viasat, a broadband communications company based in Carlsbad, California. At an internal hackathon, our team of software engineering, data analytics, marketing, and business interns developed a machine learning model to better predict customer churn and turnover, providing possible discounts and plan changes for customer care agents to suggest to dissatisfied customers. We did not win the main competition, but did win our category of “A new perspective on an old problem.”

                    The Global pillar aims at bolstering the understanding of different cultures to ensure cultural acceptance of proposed engineering solutions. At Mines, I achieved this through both in-class and hands-on experiences.
                    <br><br>My junior year, I enrolled in Asia: Politics and Society, a course at Mines taught by Professor James Jesudason. It highlighted the social, political, economic, and cultural environments of Eastern and Southeastern asian countries. As a final project, I wrote a research paper exploring how Myanmar’s Rohingya refugee crisis is influenced and fueled in part by social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Myanmar has been plagued for decades with violent conflict between their military and various ethnic and religious groups. Social media in no way induced the struggle, but in recent years, has become a powerful tool for the military to spread misinformation, cultivating a collective hatred for these minorities.
                    <br><br>In the fall of 2019, my senior year, I attended the Global Grand Challenges Summit Student Collaboration Lab in London. There I competed in a one day design competition on a team of students from China, the U.K., and the U.S. We designed a data management system for the healthcare industry based on Blockchain technology and the Ethereum network.

                    The project-based pillar is a chance for students to unify and apply the skills they have learned from the Scholar Program to a Grand Challenges-related problem.
                    <br><br>In the fall of 2019, I worked with a group of students from Mines to build a virtual reality application for Lockheed Martin. This application is for visualizing data from space object catalogs and alerting users to potential space events, like pending collisions. It consists of a global view, showing space objects and observation sites from an in-orbit perspective, a ground view that has the user look up from those observation sites, and various data-driven views for aggregating information regarding those objects, as well as monitoring events. In the future, the program will be expanded to allow the user to directly adjust orbits and send instructions to satellites.
                    <br><br>Space object visualization and manipulation are related to the Grand Challenges in that applications such as our own contribute to the Challenge of Engineering the Tools for Scientific Discovery. Lockheed Martin was previously using Tableau for visualization, a powerful visualization tool, but not well suited for satellite data. By giving the company and its clients more engaging and intuitive insight into their data, they can better understand and act on it, thus more efficiently and effectively utilizing their satellites for gathering data about and connecting the world.

                  Interdisciplinary work can be difficult. In my first year at Mines, I frankly had no idea of the mindset I needed to succeed at it. The team in NHV designed a product we thought would improve the lives of homeless people, but in the end, it just didn’t work that well. We picked a solution that didn’t play to any of our strengths, our ideas and opinions rarely meshed, and we hardly explored ideas that were outside of what we were already familiar with. I didn’t have a particularly positive experience, and for the most part, left it thinking that either our majors don’t collaborate well or that each major should just focus on what they know. Staying in our lanes weakened our product, but I took this to be a sign of incompatible expertise, not of a failure to find commonalities. It wasn’t until Canary two years later that I began to think differently.

                  Once we established the core of the product, we did move more to our own specialities. As the project progressed, I realized that I could contribute far more than just computer science. From my Entrepreneurship Pillar, I had business and marketing experience that directly applied to this project, as well. When I started focusing on what i could do outside of my major and learning from my teammates, I learned to not just throw technology at a problem and assume it will work. I came into the project with this assumption and it seems to be common among many engineers. My lane is not always the best way to approach a problem, and this isn’t a bad thing — working with others isn’t counterproductive or futile, but it can show you the errors or limitations of your own lane, augmenting it to be more useful. It can reveal ways to contribute to projects you didn’t think you could, making you an overall better engineer.

                  The Entrepreneurship Pillar is for learning ingenuity, teamwork, and communication in a venture setting. My time at Gavelgo absolutely bolstered these qualities for me, but more importantly, I gained valuable experience in marketing and customer discovery that I later applied to Canary in my Interdisciplinary Pillar. 
                  <br><br>As a software developer, I was almost entirely focused on the product's technical aspects — how the databases were designed, what information to gather from users, what new features to implement, server infrastructure, and so on. I had to be to do my job well, but now, with space and time away from the project, I see that singular focus like this may not often work in a startup setting. It might in larger, more established companies, where employees can compartmentalize responsibilities, but not one with five employees at the time. Since I had to contribute to marketing as well, my technically-minded perspective damaged it — I tried to show people the product as I saw it, describing it terms of the mechanics of customer to business interactions and what gap we were filling in the market. What I didn't realize at the time was that advertising a good or service doesn't often talk about why that product is better than others or give a laundry list of its best qualities. Instead, advertising tries to sell buyers on an idea or a feeling, conflating a particular lifestyle or virtue with that product. A car isn't just fuel efficient and safe, the driver is shown to be adventurous, well-respected, and mysterious. A phone doesn't just have a long battery life, the user appears youthful and sociable. Most companies aren't addressing Grand Challenges, but the same lesson can be applied to those that are. Buyers aren't often swayed by straight facts and "reason" about a product, so selling something like a cheaper solar panel may not work well this way. It's reasonable to see that installing solar panels is good for the environment, but advertising a lifestyle of convenience and modernity may result in wider adoption. 
                  <br><br>Ineffective advertising was not the last of Gavelgo's woes. Compounding the issue was insufficient customer discovery. I was again too concerned with developing the functional aspects of the technology, as well as delivering incremental releases to the rest of the team. I didn't focus on finding what <i>needed</i> to be created, and instead let the initial idea of what we <i>wanted</i> to make drive development. A number of businesses had expressed interest in the time I was with the company, but there seemed to be a disconnect between what the community could benefit the most from and what we offered them. Ultimately, we fell in love with the solution, not the problem.

                  Going to school for engineering, especially at an all-engineering university, can make it hard to feel connected to the rest of the world. Course content is often divorced from application and lacking a focus on people. I’ve gained valuable skills from school, but have felt they have been put to good use only when applied socially, rather than technically. Teaching as a volunteer at Excel was the first chance I got to do this. University serves to prepare you for a job, but with these kids, I finally wasn't just focusing on how I could make money or grow my own skills. I was reminded what the goal of engineering is in the first place — not to exist for its own sake or for the sake of its followers, but to improve people’s lives. Granted, I was teaching the students computer science as a potential career path in the same way Mines taught it to me, but promoting a career never felt like the goal. Instead, I just wanted the kids to better understand the technology-steeped world around them and have fun doing it. Engineerings usually improve quality of life by focusing on the health and convenience of consumers, but less often joy. This class was a refreshing chance to shift that for myself.
                  <br><br>Teaching these kids didn’t change my life. It wasn’t the first or greatest experience I’ve have volunteering or giving back to the community. But it was one of the first things I did at Mines that felt connected to the real world. For example, we designed products and programs for the homeless in Nature and Human Values freshman year, but those projects never felt very impactful. They felt like we were looking through glass, deciding for ourselves what we saw and what needed to be done. Teaching at Excel was different. I don’t think I changed any lives, but the students had never had access to programming or robotics classes before, and they seemed to genuinely enjoy the opportunity.

                  My experience at the Viasat hackathon had a similar theme of joy — the team and I wanted to make customers more satisfied with the technology already available to them; we did not want to push new technology onto them. Supported by our cost-benefit analysis, we showed that the company did not always have to charge customers <i>more</i> to profit the most from them, but this was never the goal of the project. Internet service providers have notoriously poor ratings, at least in the United States, so we simply wanted to give customers a better experience. This made pitching our idea straightforward — more money and increased customer satisfaction is a no-brainer. Most judges were immediately on board, but it wasn’t easy convincing the rest of them. The company <i>would</i> lose money in the short term and cost benefit analyses can only be so indicative of reality. There is always a risk they are incomplete, unable to account for unforeseen factors, resulting in a net loss. I think what finally won them over was considering the fact that higher customer satisfaction would result in improved company image, which could in turn drive customer recruitment. Convincing them was a learning point for me — entering the Scholars Program, I figured that nearly everyone cares about these big problems and that financial bottom lines are less of a priority to executives and investors. But not everyone shares your values and practical things like money often get in the way, so you have to tailor your pitch to each crowd differently.
                  <br><br>
                  The hackathon was a reminder that, ideally, products should keep people above profits, but taken to an extreme, that can be challenging. Money deeply influences a product’s success, regardless of whether it’s satellite WiFi or something integral in solving the Grand Challenges. Engineering is then entrenched within the economic structures around it, even if those structures make it difficult to help people. So, maybe engineering needs a way to partially or completely divorce innovations from economics, perhaps in the form of drastically increased government funding. Engineers and scientists could then focus more on getting people what they need, even if customers couldn’t afford it otherwise. A good example is the Federal Communication Commission’s Connect America Fund initiative. Internet Service Providers and broadband companies, including Viasat, are given federal subsidies for increasing rural broadband access, a historically unprofitable endeavor. Providers would love to increase access in theory, but without the monetary supplement, find the effort less appealing. Increased funding could reduce the need to choose between revenue and altruism.

                  I have an overall positive impression of social media. It improves my life in small, simple ways, with the few downsides being just first-world problems. But since its inception, social media has directly contributed to increased bullying and suicide rates, large-scale misinformation, and in many places like Myanmar, hate crimes and genocide. Before my research on it, I was largely unaware of the extent of the damages digital connection can cause. My research also revealed that many of the problems social media can bring emerged long before it was widely used in Myanmar. This suggests a lack of foresight from Western companies and an inability to learn from experience in countries with well-established digital presence. I found this observation particularly applicable to myself as an engineer — it’s easy for me to assume technological innovations will "work" everywhere. It’s easy to view technology as a universal equalizer and as a constant force for good. It’s tempting to automatically throw technology at a problem without considering the possibility that it might actually work against your goals. But, one day in class, Professor Jesudason ended his lecture with a line that has stayed with me: "Equality in opportunity is not equality in outcome." In this context, I understand this as saying that social, political, and cultural awareness cannot be an afterthought when solving Grand Challenges. Moreover, the successes and failures of previous and current implementations cannot be forgotten when expanding into new markets and countries.

                  Researching and writing the paper on social media in Myanmar taught me how technology and innovations can have unintended, unforeseen consequences when local cultures and sociopolitical climates are not well understood. My Student Collaboration team applied this understanding to MedBlock — as we developed our solution, we acknowledged that the health care systems of the world vary wildly, but not always how we expect them to. China and the United States, for instance, have quite similar methods for the electronic storage, access, and analysis of patient data, which our product could improve. But the distinct social and political forces driving those care systems mean that if we attempted to uniformly implement our product, not only would our proposal be more often rejected, it could end up failing the patients and providers we set out to help. 
                  <br><br>It’s obvious to say that things don’t work the same way in other parts of the world as they do where I'm from. I hear it so often that it has almost become white noise, and paradoxically, I consider its implications less. MedBlock reminded me that those differences should not just be taken as an implicit assumption at the start of projects, or something you know but never really think about, but as central of a focus as the goal and implementation of the product itself. 
                  <br><br>At the trade show following our presentation, my team and I talked to a mentor who pointed out our product's potential for helping immigrants, a demographic we hadn't directly considered. Seeing as many of them are displaced, they don't have the same medical resources or concerns as do the majority of medical patients in the United States. Prior to speaking with him, we had envisioned MedBlock as just working behind the scenes in hospitals, allowing them to better manage and analyze patient information, but then realized that it can be used on a much more personal basis — directly by patients. Many people, not just immigrants, don't have all their medical information readily available. Many more don’t have insurance keeping their records or a standard personal identification method, but Blockchain technology could give them a way to carry this information and patient identification with them at all times. This conversation goes to show that not only do differences in cultures and demographics mean your product may slightly change region to region, but they may reveal entirely new use cases.

                  Before I had any real experience with engineering and technology on a global scale, I remember thinking that they and the atmosphere surrounding them are a universal language where culture and politics had less influence. This lead me to believe that solutions that work in one country will, with few exceptions, work elsewhere. Asia: Politics and Society and MedBlock revealed this is not the case. Politics needs engineering to shape public policy and help lawmakers make effective and informed decisions, but engineering needs an awareness and understanding of politics also, since solutions don't necessarily work across borders.

                  This project was for my computer science “Field Session”, Mines’ way of having students culminate their undergraduate knowledge by working for real-world clients. Many types of companies participate, each offering a slightly different perspective on industry, and students choose what most interests them. Lockheed’s proposal was particularly exciting to me as an aspiring data scientist, since most other offerings focused on building something from scratch with new data, or on making certain life tasks easier. This application was different in that Lockheed was already visualizing satellites — they already had the data and a method for doing it. Tableau was working well enough, but they knew it wasn’t using their data to its full potential. They knew that visualization could be better — more customizable, immersive, and interactive. I was so excited because the project wasn’t about gathering new data or making tools to better gather that data, but about improving people's ability to interpret, understand, and apply the data we already have. It was a chance to step into an existing problem space, carefully examine how current solutions were lacking, and find what would actually fix the problem. If we hadn’t, we would not have left the realm of 2D and fragmented Lockheed’s technical environment with just another visualization tool that didn’t solve the core issue. This process helped me realize that engineering challenges don't always need more data to be solved, but instead, engineers need ways to better understand what they already have. We can have all the data in the world, but it's useless if we can’t look at it in the right way. In some cases, it could even be harmful if we misunderstand what it’s trying to tell us.
                  <br><br>Satellites are powerful tools for scientific discovery. As their numbers rise, the amount of data they collect grows rapidly. If space traffic controllers can better understand how their satellites are behaving and have better control over how they operate, they can make more informed decisions about how to modify their behavior. Those satellites can then in turn better serve our global data needs. This application obviously doesn't singlehandedly revolutionize satellite operations, but I feel that improving this data understanding step plays a part in removing the busywork of manually interpreting operational data so that scientists and engineers can instead focus on discovering new insights.

            Engineering is not what I thought it would be. I came to Mines for computer science simply because I enjoyed writing software and didn't know much about engineering beyond that. From what little I did know, my perception was it is largely concerned with building new machines and structures for the purpose of industry. This is not entirely wrong, and my classes at mines showed me other types that exist, but I was wrong about the purpose. Whether it tries to or not, Mines as a university inherently teaches engineering as a means of getting a job and making money. Again, this is not wrong or immoral, but it does not stress the social aspect of engineering and how it is not just in service of industry. It fails to show engineering’s potential for building a more sustainable society, increasing health and joy, or altruism. It wasn’t until I joined the Scholars Program that I began to understand that potential through the lens of the large-scale problems the world is facing. 
            <br><br>When I joined the program, I didn’t really know what to expect. I assumed it focuses on further explaining the Grand Challenges themselves — why they arose, what the technical problems are, and what the solutions should look like. So I was pleasantly surprised when it was more open-ended, working to develop necessary soft skills. This is directly antithetical to another theme I have observed at Mines: there is one correct solution and if you do the math and build the right system, you’ll find it. What helped me begin to unlearn this mentality was a common thread among many of my pillars — technical solutions are not always the answer, and throwing technology at a problem is not always effective. For Canary, this meant that reinventing the pollution mask wouldn’t differentiate our product or convince more people to use a mask, but leveraging what already exists could. For Gavelgo, it was starting with strong customer discovery instead of charging forward building what we initially wanted to build. For MedBlock, building something that could adapt to diverse political and cultural environments, instead one a single, monolithic system. For Lockheed, building something that actually addressed the issues with current visualizations and that didn’t unintentionally exacerbate those issues.
            <br><br>
            Looking into the future, my next job does not address any Grand Challenges, but I would love to continue contributing to their solutions. What I find most interesting is the Challenge of reverse engineering the brain, as it intersects engineering, computer science, and another love of mine, neuroscience. I also have a more personal connection to this Challenge, as Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia run in my family. Data science and machine learning are typically associated with enhancing business insight and building artificial intelligence to improve customer experience, not so much for understanding the biological brain and preventing the issues that arise with it. This would also fit into my desire to further explore the role of computer science in the Grand Challenges and engineering as a whole. There are Challenges geared toward it, like securing cyberspace, but I spent most of the program developing other skills, often feeling I was acting as a computer scientist second. I would love to better understand how computer science can impact all of engineering, perhaps by looking at how engineers and scientists can take more data-driven approaches to their work.

            When I started school, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I had no idea what engineering is fully capable of. I had no idea how entrenched in social systems engineering is, or how and why that can be a good thing. As stressful and time-consuming as it was, I’m glad that I came to Mines. It opened up new possibilities for my future and gave me a glimpse of the tremendous amount of good science and technology can do. Engineering is not what I thought it would be. It’s so much better.

            I want to preface this section by reiterating how much I appreciate the Scholars Program augmenting my education at Mines and helping me grow as an engineer. Mines can be an extremely stressful, rigid, and pedantic. As much as I knew what engineering can be and can be used for, the coursework often felt divorced from the Mines ethos of “Earth, Energy, and Environment”. While it was hard to keep in mind all the good engineering can do, this program was a constant reminder of why I was there. That being said, I think it could be more involved in guiding students through their activities. The program tells students to complete certain types of activities that will teach them about teamwork, innovation, and multiculturalism, then has them reflect on what they have learned in a portfolio. If students have not had much prior exposure to a particular pillar, they may be going in blind, not knowing exactly what sort of experience they should be gaining or what skills they should be developing. This hands-off approach is good to a large extent, since it highlights the open-endedness and "no one right answer" mentality of the Grand Challenges, but I think that students could benefit from being pointed in the right direction. They shouldn’t be told what to think or exactly what they should learn, but they could be shown what to aim at and what to look out for during the activities. Often students, like me, complete a number of pillars before even joining the program, so prior guidance will not always be possible, but it may help otherwise.

            At the same time, the Scholars Program at Mines fixes the reservations I have with the Grand Challenges themselves. The program stresses the social political and cultural aspects of challenges, like access to clean water, but the report barely does at all. It passingly mentions "[integrating] methods and solutions with the goals and desires of all society’s members", but then frames each Challenge almost entirely in terms of technical problem solving. The engineers and scientists that wrote the report understandably expressed the Challenges in terms of their expertise. They are the "Engineering" Grand Challenges, after all. But in framing them that way, what is not shown is the understanding that these problems are not just for engineering, downplaying the professed need for social, political, economic, and cultural understanding and competence. The result is that many of the Challenges are expressed as particular solutions, not the core issues those technologies address. Take the call to “Make Solar Power Economical”, for example. The reader can infer that this means the core problem is combating climate change and avoiding its adverse effects, but it immediately rules out all other options for clean renewable energy. The Challenges should state what the problem is, not what the solution should be. Then they would properly acknowledge that the Challenges are part of larger societal concerns outside of engineering, and that if engineers should be taking a truly interdisciplinary approach to solving them, we should be only one party in a vast effort to addressing not the <i>Engineering</i> Grand Challenges, but the <i>Global</i> Grand Challenges.
            <br><br>
            As stated elsewhere, what is absent from the discussion of the Challenges is acknowledgement of what caused them in the first place. I would like to add that they also do not acknowledge the fact that fallout from these problems disproportionately harms smaller, more developing countries. Countries that didn’t get us in this situation in the first place and contribute far less to it worsening. For example, the richest twenty percent of the global population accounts for roughly eighty percent of emissions, but it’s the poorest countries that bear the brunt of the damages. Technical solutions themselves cannot account for this disparity. The Challenges will never be overcome if equity is not a priority.
